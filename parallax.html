<h2>EXPLORE NATURE</h2>
<p>The natural world is an incredible wonder that inspires us all. It underpins our economy, our society, indeed our very existence. Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our health, happiness and prosperity. 
These natural assets are often called the world's 'natural capital'. These benefits are also hugely important to the economy – from farming and forestry to leisure and tourism. If you add them all up, the total value of these benefits is phenomenal – at least US$125 trillion every year.
Because nature is free, we often take it for granted and overexploit it. We clear forests, overfish oceans, pollute rivers and build over wetlands without taking account of the impact this will have. By not taking into account the benefits we get from nature, we create huge social and economic costs for ourselves.

                <h2>STOP POLLUTION TO SAVE NATURE</h2>
                <p>There might be some people wondering about the need to stop pollution when the environment is not so much in ruins as people portray it to be. Well, the fact is that the environment is much more affected than any of us know. Controlling pollution will reduce health hazards, liability risk, economic losses; and provide us with clean air, better lifestyle, clear visibility, safe environment for all inhabitants of the Earth and so on .Multiple efforts have been taken by the governments of various countries and organizations around the world to reduce the effects of pollution on our environment. One of the initiatives taken by the United Nations is the United Nations Environment Programme with the mission to inspire people all around the world, to work together, to care for the environment, and take steps to improve the quality of life, not just for ourselves, but for the future generations as well. The United Nations has also designated June 5 of every year to be World Environment Day in order to bring representatives of all member nations together to address the environmental problems, to create awareness and to instigate action.The answer to all the environmental problems the world is facing today is immediate action and consistency in reduced usage of private transportation, machinery with possible carbon emission and proper disposal of waste to start with.
